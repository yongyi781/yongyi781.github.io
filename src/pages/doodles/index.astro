      <Card name="Modular form plotter" href="/doodles/modular-forms">
        <p>
          Modular forms are amazing creatures from number theory. I made this tool to help visualize them. Made with
          Svelte and CindyJS.

      <Card name="Musical Spectrogram" href="/doodles/spectrogram" target="_blank">
        <p>
          A spectrogram that is color-coded so you can identify pitches in any sound easily. I made this to have a
          version of the (no longer maintained) PitchLab iOS app that is usable on a PC. I use this a lot!

        <p>
          Inspired by the question <i>What would the world look like if we lived on a mÃ¶bius strip?</i>, I made this
          demo using HTML and Vue to answer this question. This demo generalizes possible topologies of maps far beyond
          mobius strips, and you can even make your own custom maps. See for yourself!

        <p>
          A little Lights Out solver. Check the source code for how linear algebra over the finite field of order 2 is
          used in the theory behind solving this game!

      <Card name="Very simple KaTeX live preview" href="/doodles/katex" target="_blank">
        <p>
          Does exactly what the name says. Nothing fancy. Uses local storage to save LaTeX code between sessions. Good
          for previewing wall-of-text math that you want to type into Discord or a forum.

      <Card name="Frequency discrimination test" href="/doodles/freq-test" target="_blank">
        <p>
          A HTML and JS app I designed to measure frequency discrimination using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC),
          as part of a summer UROP project in the RLE lab at MIT. I'm sure you'll do much better than I did on this test
          ðŸ˜‹. Uses <code>knockout.js</code> and <code>Tone.js</code>.

        target="_blank">
        <p>
          In 2013, I made a completely tick-for-tick square-for-square accurate emulator of a minigame in RuneScape
          called <b>The Great Orb Project</b>, or GOP for short (any connection to the Republican party is
          coincidental). It also contains a solved reconstruction of Jagex's line of sight algorithm. This was made
          using ASP.NET Core, HTML, and JS. As of now, it is not hosted anywhere, so this card will take you to the
          GitHub repository instead. The website also over 200 GOP puzzles, and a map editor that allowed you to create
          and submit your own maps.

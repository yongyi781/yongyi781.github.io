      <Card name="Modular form plotter" href="/doodles/modular-forms">
        <p>
          Modular forms are amazing creatures from number theory. I made this tool to help visualize them. Made with
          Svelte and CindyJS.

      <Card name="Musical Spectrogram" href="/doodles/spectrogram" target="_blank">
        <p>
          A spectrogram that is color-coded so you can identify pitches in any sound easily. I made this to have a
          version of the (no longer maintained) PitchLab iOS app that is usable on a PC. I use this a lot!

      <Card name="Living in other topologies" href="/doodles/mobius" target="_blank">
        <p>
          Inspired by the question <i>What would the world look like if we lived on a mÃ¶bius strip?</i>, I made this
          demo using HTML and Vue to answer this question. This demo generalizes possible topologies of maps far beyond
          mobius strips, and you can even make your own custom maps. See for yourself!

      <Card name="Lights out solver" href="/doodles/lights-out" target="_blank">
        <p>
          A little Lights Out solver. Check the source code for how linear algebra over the finite field of order 2 is
          used in the theory behind solving this game!

      <Card name="Frequency discrimination test" href="/doodles/freq-test" target="_blank">
        <p>
          A HTML and JS app I designed to measure frequency discrimination using two-alternative forced choice (2AFC),
          as part of a summer UROP project in the RLE lab at MIT. I'm sure you'll do much better than I did on this test
          ðŸ˜‹. Uses <code>knockout.js</code> and <code>Tone.js</code>.
